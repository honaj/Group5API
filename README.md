## About Demo
This demonstrates KUTE.js's core engine, and CSS, SVG, Attribute plugins through simulating a portfolio website. <br>
The website is divided into 3 pages: introduction, project, detailed project.<br>
The introduction page shows how each letter can be animated by using opacity, scale, and text properties. The chain method is used to connect color animation. <br>
The project page shows how elements can be transformed through use of translate property, rotate property, and size.<br>
The detailed project shows example of SVG path animation, scale animation, clip property animation, plus translate and opacity animation.<br>
The easing functions has been applied to all movements. This provides unique curve that adds natural pace.
